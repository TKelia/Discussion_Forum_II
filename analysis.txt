Time Complexity Analysis:
- Both DFS and BFS have O(V + E) time complexity
- V = 12 vertices, E = 14 edges
- Space complexity: O(V) for visited array

Other algorithms using DFS:
- Topological sorting
- Cycle detection
- Connected components

Other algorithms using BFS:
- Shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Level order traversal
- Bipartite graph checking
